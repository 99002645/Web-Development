        <h1>Discover Our History</h1><br/>
        <div> 
            <p>Oyo Rooms, also known as Oyo Hotels & Homes, is an Indian hospitality chain of leased and franchised hotels, homes and living spaces. Founded in 2013 by Ritesh Agarwal, OYO initially consisted mainly of budget hotels.</p>

                * Affordable: It offers rooms at affordable prices as compared to the rooms of other budget hotels.<br/>
                * Technology Driven: It uses pioneering technology to deliver better services and more efficient operations and management. Its app allows you book a room in just 3 clicks or within 5-10 seconds.<br/>
                * Simple Booking: Whether you book a hotel online, on the phone, or through a travel agent, it should be a simple process. It should be easy to contact a knowledgeable, helpful person if you have questions, changes to your initial booking, or special requests. Anything else is a red flag.<br/>
                * Fast, Friendly First Contact: When you first pull up to a hotel entrance or walk into the lobby, your initial encounter tells you plenty about the type of place you’re staying.<br/>
                * A Genuinely Cheerful, Helpful, Knowledgeable Staff: There’s a fundamental difference between fake cheerfulness and genuine warmth. Great hotels hire people with intuitive qualities: observant, empathetic, kind, and funny. Harrison describes them as people “who quietly make guests feel comfortable and important.”
                One way good employees accomplish this feat is knowing enough about the facility and the town you’re in, so they don’t have to hand you off to someone else when you have a basic question.<br/>
